# FASS-ECG: FHIR API to Stream and Store long-term ECGs
  
![A general structure for streaming an ECG on the internet containing multiple and diverse IoT devices, cloud APIs, and user applications.](./img/fass-ecg-overview.png)

This repo contains FASS-ECG, a FHIR Cloud API to Enable Streaming and Storage of Continuous 12-leads ECGs. Figure shows a general structure of an IoT-based ECG monitoring system containing diverse components labeled IoT devices, cloud APIs, and user-interface applications. FASS-ECG is a cloud API to enable the IoT-based ECG monitoring and FASS-ECG paper has been published in [IEEE CBMS 2023](https://2023.cbms-conference.org/) conference.

```
1. FASS-ECG defines an ECG writing flow to enable distributed long-term ECG writing by a sequence of expected HTTP requests. The endpoints available to write ECGs in FASS-ECG are as follows:

![ECG writing flow estblished in FASS-ECG.](./img/fass-ecg-writing-flow.jpg)

| Endpoint               | Method | Description                                         |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `/Observation` | POST | Create a new FHIR Observation resource of ECG record and begin the ECG streaming; |
| `/Observation/{id}` | PATCH | Attach new ECG samples as JSON Patch document in the ECG record previously created in the POST request. |
| `/Observation/{id}` | PUT | Finish the ECG streaming by updating `status` key to `"final"`. |

2. Three endpoints are available to read ECGs from FASS-ECG where two of them return ECGs snippets in a time period as follows:

| Endpoint               | Method | Description                                         |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `/Observation/{id}` | GET | read a complete ECG record as a FHIR Observation resourc |
| `/Observation/{id}/data/{minute}` | GET | read one minute of an ECG record as a FHIR Observation resource. The first `{minute}` is set as 0; |
| `/Observation/{id}/data/{start}/{end}` | GET | read an ECG record as a FHIR Observation resource in a time interval between `{start}` and `{end}` minutes |
